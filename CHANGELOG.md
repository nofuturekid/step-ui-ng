## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.2] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Foundation persistence (`internal/store`): pure-Go SQLite opened under
  `DATA_DIR`, with embedded, idempotent goose migrations applied on startup
  (spec/0001). Wired into server boot; logs the applied schema version.

### Changed

- Align repo conventions and CI to the `main` branch (docs + workflow triggers).
- CI derives the Go version from `go.mod` (now `1.25`, required by the SQLite/goose
  dependencies) and enables module caching.
- Migrate the golangci-lint config to the v2 format.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Initial scaffold: project layout, build/CI tooling, ADRs (MADR) and feature
  specs (SDD), minimal compiling HTTP skeleton with a health endpoint and tests.
